Static:
The default position value for elements.
Elements with position: static are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
They are not affected by the top, bottom, left, right, or z-index properties.

<div class="static-position">
  This is a static positioned element.
</div>

.static-position {
  position: static;
}



Fixed:
The element is positioned relative to the viewport (browser window).
It remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.
Use top, bottom, left, right properties to control the exact position.


<div class="fixed-position">
  This is a fixed positioned element.
</div>

.fixed-position {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}


Sticky:
The element behaves like position: relative within its parent until a specified threshold (top/bottom position) is reached, then it becomes position: fixed.
It is positioned relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor or the viewport if no scrolling ancestor exists.
Useful for creating sticky headers or navigation menus that stay visible as the user scrolls.


<div class="sticky-position">
  This is a sticky positioned element.
</div>

.sticky-position {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
}

Relative:
The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
It does not affect the positioning of other elements.
Use top, bottom, left, right properties to move the element from its normal position.


<div class="relative-position">
  This is a relative positioned element.
</div>


.relative-position {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}


Absolute:
The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (a parent element with position other than static) or the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists.
It is taken out of the normal document flow, and other elements are positioned as if it doesn't exist.
Use top, bottom, left, right properties to specify the exact position.


<div class="absolute-position">
  This is an absolute positioned element.
</div>

.absolute-position {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
}
